Maven Repository Metadata Model

 This is strictly the model for Maven Repository Metadata, so really just plain objects.

 Maven Repository Metadata is available in directories representing:

 [[1]] an un-versioned artifact: it gives informations about available versions of the artifact,

 [[2]] a snapshot artifact: it gives precise information on the snapshot,

 [[3]] a group containing Maven plugins artifacts: it gives informations on plugins available in this group.

 []

 The metadata file name is:

 * <<<maven-metadata.xml>>> in a remote repository,

 * <<<maven-metadata-\<repo-id>.xml>>> in a local repository, for metatada from a repository with <<<repo-id>>> identifier.

 []

 The following are generated from this model:

   * {{{./apidocs/index.html}Java sources}} with Reader and Writers for the Xpp3 XML parser, to read and write <<<maven-metadata(-*).xml>>> files

   * A {{{./repository-metadata.html}Descriptor Reference}}
